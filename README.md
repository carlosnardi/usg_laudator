# usg_laudator

This is a project called USG laudator in which, with a few selections, it is possible to generate the thyroid ultrasound report with the American College of Radiologists - TIRADS calculated automatically. 

In the future, I will add conditions for reporting ultrasound of salivary glands and cervical soft tissues too.

For now, the code is based on Ruby with the planning to develop an application with ruby on rails in the future.

Thanks
